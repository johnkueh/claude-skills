# dev-up — local dev servers + worktree QA, one verb each

The day-to-day surface is the verbs: `dev-up`/`dev-down`/`dev-status` for any
checkout or worktree, `metro-takeover` + `expo-qa` for Expo QA, `worktrees-gc`
for cleanup. Underneath: a free Cloudflare Tunnel + a tiny host-preserving
proxy in front of [portless](https://github.com/vercel-labs/portless) replaces
ngrok — one persistent tunnel handles every web project under a single
wildcard subdomain (free, no timeouts, wildcard = zero per-worktree config),
Expo apps get individual ingress entries. (Formerly `cloudflare-tunnel-portless`.)

**The mechanical procedures live in scripts, not prose.** Don't reassemble
setup or wiring steps by hand — run the script; each one is idempotent and
prints what a human still has to do.

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| Start/stop/inspect a dev server (any checkout/worktree) | `dev-up` / `dev-down` / `dev-status` |
| One-time machine onboarding | `setup.sh <domain> [--tag t] [--tunnel name]` |
| Wire a new project | `add-project.sh web [name]` or `add-project.sh expo <hostname> <port>` |
| Health-check the whole chain | `doctor.sh` |
| Swap Expo Metro to this worktree | `metro-takeover.sh` |
| Expo QA gate / EAS Update publish / client record | `expo-qa.sh gate|publish|record` |
| Prune landed agent worktrees | `worktrees-gc.sh [--dry-run]` |

## dev-up / dev-down / dev-status — START HERE for day-to-day use

Three commands (symlinked into `~/.local/bin` from `dev.sh` in this skill) own
the whole lifecycle:

```bash
dev-up        # from anywhere inside any checkout or worktree
dev-down      # stop what dev-up started here (or: dev-down <name>, --all, --force)
dev-status    # infra health + every route, local + public URLs
```

`dev-up` does, in order: detect the repo root, surface (`web/`, repo root, or
Expo `app/`) and whether this is a worktree → ensure the tunnel chain is alive
(kickstarts launchd agents) → **seed env into worktrees** (copies `.env*` from
the main checkout, or runs the project's `scripts/dev-env-seed.sh` if present)
→ `pnpm install` if `node_modules` is missing → start the server under
portless with the right name → wait for ready → probe the public URL → print
local + public URLs, log path, and the stop command.

Naming: main checkout → the portless name from the `dev` script (`portless
<name> …`), or the package.json name for `portless run`, or the repo dir
basename for plain dev scripts (which dev-up wraps in portless automatically).
Worktree → `<branch>-<name>`, **flat single label** so the wildcard TLS cert
covers it (nested `branch.project.<DOMAIN>` hosts have NO cert on free
Universal SSL — HTTPS handshake fails). Override with `DEVUP_NAME`; TLD comes
from the pubproxy LaunchAgent (`DEVUP_TLD` to override). Cross-origin artifact
hosts work the same way: `art-<name>` is still one label, and pubproxy routes
an unregistered `art-<name>` host to `<name>`'s server.

In an Expo `app/` dir, `dev-up` delegates to `metro-takeover.sh`. Convention:
`pnpm dev` in Expo apps is **simulator-local** (no tunnel env, survives tunnel
outages); `pnpm dev:phone` is the tunnel variant for physical-device testing
via `<project>-app.<DOMAIN>`.

Safety: `dev-down` only kills processes dev-up started (pidfile under
`~/.dev-up/<name>/`); for servers started by hand it refuses unless `--force`.
`dev-up` is idempotent — if the route is already live it just reprints the URLs.

### Simulator pool: `dev-up --sim` (Expo, opt-in)

`dev-up --sim` (or `DEVUP_HANGAR=1 dev-up`) leases a simulator from the
[hangar](../hangar) pool before starting Metro, so many worktrees/agents each
get their own sim **and** Metro port with no collisions; `dev-down` releases the
lease (sim returns to the pool). Without `--sim`, behavior is unchanged. The
leased port reaches Metro two ways, both already wired:

- **Has a `dev` script:** make its port overridable — `expo start … --port
  ${MT_PORT:-8082}` (zero-regression: unset → the old default). The lease exports
  `MT_PORT`; the script binds it; metro-takeover waits on it.
- **No committed `dev` script** (team monorepo): set `MT_CMD` (+ `MT_APP_DIR` /
  `MT_SCHEME`) in `~/.dev-up/projects/<repo>.env` — a machine-local, never-committed
  override file `dev-up` sources by the main checkout's dir name. Force the Expo
  surface with `dev-up app --sim` when the app isn't at `$ROOT/app`.

**Mobile web (no Metro), e.g. Safari QA:** there's nothing to delegate — start the
web server with `dev-up`, lease a sim yourself (`eval "$(hangar lease --app x)"`),
and drive Safari at the printed URL with `argent … --udid "$HANGAR_UDID" open-url`.

## Architecture

```
phone / external network
  → *.<your-tunnel-domain>             (Cloudflare wildcard CNAME → tunnel UUID)
  → cloudflared tunnel run dev         (one persistent process)
      ├─ wildcard rule → pubproxy :1354 (host-preserving lookup against
      │                                  portless's routes.json)
      │                                → 127.0.0.1:<dev-port> directly
      └─ Expo entries  → Metro :8081   (one ingress rule per Expo app,
                                        before wildcard)

laptop (local)
  → http://<project>.localhost:1355   → portless :1355 → 127.0.0.1:<dev-port>
```

Why each layer exists:
- **portless** auto-allocates a port per `pnpm dev`, dispatches by Host header,
  and auto-handles worktrees — load-bearing for parallel coding agents.
- **pubproxy** (`pubproxy.js`, ~80 lines, in this skill) forwards public-tunnel
  traffic by reading portless's `routes.json` **without rewriting Host**. It
  replaced a Caddy host-rewriter that broke downstream URL builders (Clerk
  Dev's handshake most painfully — see Troubleshooting).
- **Cloudflare Tunnel** terminates TLS at the edge, no open inbound ports,
  faster than ngrok and free.

## Setup (one-time per machine)

Human prerequisites first (dashboard clicks; `setup.sh` checks and stops with
instructions if missing): own a domain, add it as a free Cloudflare zone,
switch nameservers at the registrar, and `cloudflared tunnel login` (browser
authorize). Then:

```bash
/abs/path/to/dev-up/setup.sh <domain>     # idempotent; --tag <t> for the plist label, --tunnel <name> if not "dev"
/abs/path/to/dev-up/doctor.sh             # verify; run it any time something feels off
```

`setup.sh` installs/locates the **brew** cloudflared (never the pnpm
node-wrapper — it dies under launchd), creates the tunnel, routes wildcard
DNS, writes `~/.cloudflared/config.yml` (never clobbers an existing one),
writes + loads both LaunchAgents (pubproxy on `:1354`, cloudflared), and runs
doctor. `doctor.sh` checks the whole chain — binary, agents, config sanity,
portless, pubproxy, DNS, end-to-end probe, Expo ingress status, and a
`*_PUBLIC_*` secret audit — printing a concrete fix command per failure.

### Lock down access (immediately after setup — both free)

The wildcard cert lands in Certificate Transparency logs within minutes, so
subdomain names are **public, not secret**: scanners can reach any dev server
that's running. Two dashboard settings remove ~95% of the risk:

1. **Cloudflare Access**: Zero Trust → Access → Applications → Add
   (Self-hosted), domain `*.<DOMAIN>`, Allow policy on your email(s).
   **Expo caveat:** the dev client can't render the Access login page — add a
   second Access application per `<project>-app.<DOMAIN>` with a **Bypass**
   policy (acceptable: the host is unguessable-in-practice and the bundle is
   mostly public client code).
2. **Bot Fight Mode**: Security → Bots → On.

Plus two habits: never put real secrets in `EXPO_PUBLIC_*`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_*`
vars (they compile into the downloadable bundle — doctor audits this), and
kill dev servers when done (`dev-down`) — a stopped server is a 404; the blast
radius is whatever's running right now. The cloudflared daemon itself is
outbound-only; webhook endpoints are signature-verified; tunnel credentials at
rest are useless without local shell access (recreate the tunnel if leaked).

## Per-project wiring

```bash
add-project.sh web [name]                  # web: prints the dev-script change; nothing to wire
add-project.sh expo <hostname> <port>      # expo: ingress entry + cloudflared reload + dev script to paste
```

**Web projects need zero tunnel config** — make the dev script `portless run
next dev` (or `portless <explicit-name> next dev` when package.json names
collide, e.g. a workspace literally named "web"; dots become hyphens; inspect
with `portless list`). Drop hardcoded port flags (portless injects `PORT`),
delete old ngrok scripts, and repoint webhook URLs (Clerk/Stripe/GitHub — both
`.env` and the provider dashboard) at `https://<project>.<DOMAIN>`.

**Expo apps don't fit the portless dispatch pattern** (Metro is one HTTP+WS
server on a known port), so each gets a specific ingress entry before the
wildcard — that's what `add-project.sh expo` edits. Naming: `<project>-app.<DOMAIN>`
when the repo also has a web side; bare `<project>.<DOMAIN>` for standalone
apps. Pin Metro's port in the dev script so the ingress holds; the script
prints the exact `EXPO_PACKAGER_PROXY_URL=… REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=…`
dev script to paste (both vars must match the public hostname — one controls
the manifest's bundle URL, the other the QR). To run two Expo worktrees live
simultaneously, pin a second port and add a second ingress entry; the default
serial workflow needs neither (see metro-takeover).

## Worktree cleanup (`worktrees-gc.sh`)

Prunes agent worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` whose work has landed. A
worktree is removed only when **all three** hold: clean working tree, the work
landed, and nothing outside build dirs (`node_modules`, `.next`, `.expo`,
`ios/build`, `ios/Pods`, `android/build`, `android/.gradle`) was touched in
the last 6 hours — a co-running agent session is never yanked. "Landed" means
HEAD is an ancestor of `origin/<default-branch>` (detected: main, master,
whatever origin/HEAD says), **or** — for squash/rebase-merged PRs, where
ancestry never holds — `gh` finds a merged PR for the branch whose head SHA
equals the worktree's HEAD (a branch with commits added after the merge is
kept). It does NOT prescribe a merge style; the gh check degrades to KEEP
without gh/GitHub. Everything kept is listed with its reason; `--dry-run`
previews. Idempotent, never touches the main checkout. pnpm worktrees cost far
less disk than `du` suggests (hard-linked store) — run for hygiene, not panic.

## Switching Metro between worktrees (`metro-takeover.sh`)

Kills any running Metro, starts the current worktree's, waits for ready, emits
a clickable dev-client deeplink (OSC-8). The serial-QA pattern: agent in
worktree A takes over Metro, QAs on the sim; agent B takes over after — one
Metro, one pinned port, one dev client at a time.

Autodetects from the skill-conformant setup; override with env vars:

| Variable | Default source | Override |
|---|---|---|
| App dir | git root, prefer `<root>/app` if it has an expo dep | `MT_APP_DIR` |
| Port | `--port N` parsed from the `dev` script; fallback 8081 | `MT_PORT` |
| Tunnel URL | `EXPO_PACKAGER_PROXY_URL` from the dev script; fallback localhost | `MT_URL` |
| Scheme | `app.json` → `expo config --json` run with the dev script's env (so `isDev ? 'x-dev' : 'x'` resolves the dev variant) | `MT_SCHEME` |
| Launch | `<pm> run dev` (requires a `dev` script) | `MT_CMD` |

pnpm monorepo case handled: resolves `<app>/node_modules/.bin/expo`, then
`<root>/…`, then `$PATH` (npx doesn't always walk up to the hoisted binary).

**No committed `dev` script? `MT_CMD`.** Projects driven entirely from tooling —
a reviewed team monorepo you don't want to commit a personal dev script into —
opt in fully out-of-repo: set `MT_CMD` to the full start command, `MT_APP_DIR`
to the app dir, `MT_SCHEME` to the dev-client scheme, and `MT_PORT` to the port
(e.g. a hangar-leased one). `MT_CMD` gets `--port <N>` appended unless it pins
one itself. Nothing lands in the target repo — no `dev` script, no PR, survives
rebases. Example (a monorepo app at `clients/apps/expo` with no `dev` script):

```bash
MT_APP_DIR="$REPO/clients/apps/expo" MT_CMD="expo start --dev-client" \
  MT_SCHEME="exp+myapp" MT_PORT="$HANGAR_PORT" metro-takeover.sh
```

## Expo QA: fingerprint gate + EAS Update publish (`expo-qa.sh`)

Metro takeover is the **inner loop** (HMR, one worktree at a time). `expo-qa.sh`
is the **correctness gate and the parallel review path**:

```bash
expo-qa.sh gate                 # is the installed dev client valid for this branch?
expo-qa.sh publish [--dry-run]  # gate, then eas update --branch wt/<branch>
expo-qa.sh record               # after building+installing a dev client: pin its fingerprint
```

**`gate`** compares the worktree's `@expo/fingerprint` hash (iOS default,
`--platform android` to switch) against the default-branch checkout. Match
(exit 0) → branch is JS-only; QA on the installed dev client — Metro or
published update — is valid. Mismatch (exit 2) → the branch changes the native
layer; "verified on sim" through the shared client would be a false positive —
the branch needs its own `eas build --profile development` (differing sources
are printed). Run it before claiming any simulator verification. It's the only
protection on **pinned** `runtimeVersion` projects (a native-drifted update
loads, then crashes); on `policy: 'fingerprint'` projects it predicts whether
a published update will even be loadable.

**`record`** closes the gate's blind spot: the *installed client* can predate
the baseline — it lists new updates but greys out Open (fingerprint runtime)
or loads them against wrong natives (pinned). `record` pins the fingerprint of
the tree a dev client was just built from to `~/.expo-qa/<app>-<platform>.json`;
project `local-build.sh` wrappers call it automatically after successful dev
builds (template in the dev-expo skill). With a record, `gate` adds a
third verdict — **CLIENT STALE, exit 3** — and `publish` refuses with "rebuild
the dev client first" (`--skip-gate` if you'll load on a fresher device).

**`publish`** runs the gate, then `eas update --branch wt/<branch>` from the
app dir with the dev script's env applied (so `APP_VARIANT`-style variants
resolve like the running client), and emits the dev-client deeplink. This is
the parallel-QA bus: N worktrees publish concurrently, zero Metro/port/sim
contention, loadable on any dev client — sim or physical phone, no Mac awake,
works on cellular. ~1–2 min latency, no HMR: review path, not dev loop. The
`wt/` prefix is enforced and the default branch refused, so a publish can
never reach a release channel (channels map to branches explicitly; nothing
maps to `wt/*`). Where a project's OTA releases need separate authorization
(e.g. an Expo app), that covers channel-mapped branches — still surface `wt/*`
publishes in your report.

| Variable | Default source | Override |
|---|---|---|
| App dir | git root, prefer `<root>/app` with an expo dep | `EQ_APP_DIR` |
| Baseline | the git worktree checked out on the default branch | `EQ_BASELINE_DIR` |
| Platform | `ios` | `EQ_PLATFORM` / `--platform` |
| Scheme | `app.json` → `expo config --json` with dev-script env | `EQ_SCHEME` |
| Message | last commit subject | `--message` |
| EAS environment | `development` (eas-cli requires one non-interactively) | `EQ_EAS_ENV` / `--environment` |

pnpm gotcha (verified in practice): each tree is fingerprinted with **its
own** `node_modules/.bin/fingerprint` — a bin borrowed from another checkout
hashes an identical tree differently. Handled; version skew between trees
produces a warning (mismatch may be algorithm drift). Both trees need deps
installed.

## Troubleshooting

### `https://<project>.<DOMAIN>` returns portless's 404

Portless doesn't know that name. Check: dev server actually running? name
matches `portless list` (or `<branch>-<name>` for worktrees)? dev script uses
`portless run`/`portless <name>`? chain alive (`lsof -nP -iTCP:1354
-sTCP:LISTEN`, same for `:1355`, `tail ~/.cloudflared/cloudflared.log` shows
"Registered tunnel connection")?

### Redirects / Clerk Dev bouncing to `<project>.localhost`

This is what pubproxy fixes — the old Caddy host-rewriter broke Next.js
redirects, OG `metadataBase`, and Clerk Dev's `dev_browser` handshake
(fresh devices bounced to `<project>.localhost:1355` → connection refused).
If it resurfaces: is `:1354` held by `node` (not a leftover `caddy` — `brew
services list | grep caddy` should be none)? is the project in
`~/.portless/routes.json`? pubproxy returns its own explicit 404 when it has
no route — that's portless registration, not the bounce. Last resort for a
project that truly can't run Clerk Dev behind a tunnel: a Clerk Production
instance on a real subdomain (invasive; rarely worth it).

### cloudflared keeps reconnecting / one connection flaps

Normal — it holds 4 redundant edge connections; single flaps are harmless
while ≥3 are stable.

### Phone can't reach it but laptop can

Confirm cellular works (`https://1.1.1.1` from the phone). If the laptop works
and the phone doesn't, the laptop is resolving via something local (e.g.
`.localhost`); public DNS → Cloudflare IPs → tunnel works everywhere.

### `tunnel route dns` fails with "record exists"

`-f` solves CNAME-vs-CNAME. A leftover wildcard **A** record (Cloudflare
sometimes auto-creates one on zone import) must be deleted in the dashboard.

### WebSocket HMR isn't working

Tunnel + pubproxy pass WebSockets natively. If HMR fails, the page is probably
constructing the WS URL from the wrong host — same root cause as the redirect
issue.
